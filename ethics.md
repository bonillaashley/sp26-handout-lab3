## (Answer before group discussion) Stakeholder-value Matrix

Last week, we discussed privacy for people whose data might be in the contents of the 311 calls. This week, your assignment is to build a stakeholder-value matrix for your sorting criteria.

Part of Homework 3 requires you to determine appropriate "urgency rankings" for at least 10 categories. A higher ranking indicades more urgency.

1. Please write your urgency rankings here:

#1: street light outage, 2: fallen trees, 3. wild animals , 4. streelight knockdown, 5: domestic animal issue, 6: street light other, 7: branches, 8: lost pet, 9: tree or stump removal, 10: pruning request 


2. Then, please write a stakeholder-value matrix for your urgency ranking system with at least three values and three stakeholders. You may replace the contents of the table below.

|  | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |

| pet owners | values their pets | looks out for animals  | would want a proper environment for their pets |

| parents | safe area to live in  | ability to communicate with children | maybe want protection  |

| commuters | clean area | ability to drive without issues | no distractions |


3. Then, please answer these questions. You will need to have done the visualization part of Homework 3 to answer them, but the group discussion below does not require you to have answered these questions.
   
   1. Based on your bar graph of cases that remain open longer than average (per neighborhood), which stakeholders are prioritized by the system, and who is de-prioritized? Parents are prioritizied and pet owners are de-proritizied. 
   
   2. Can the scatterplot of case locations mislead someone? What would someone take away as the "main point" if they saw your scatterplot with no other context?
someone might take away that a specific location has a lot of issues when in reality this is not the case. 


## (Answer after group discussion) Comparing priorities

1. Who are some stakeholders that you prioritized in your urgency ranking, which others chose to de-prioritize? How is that reflected in both your urgency rankings?
   I prioritized commuters but others did not, in both our urgency rankings we valued the issues concerning the area.  


2. Who are some stakeholders that others prioritized in their urgency rankings, which you chose to de-prioritize? How is that reflected in both your urgency rankings?
   One of them are people who execrise outside such as ride bikes, runners, walkers, etc. In both our urgency rankings, the environment outside homes were highly valued therefore I can see why they choose these stakeholders.
